    </header>

    <!-- Intro section -->
    <section class="intro">
      As a team driven by innovation, we see sustainability not just as a goal, but as a mindset. One that guides how we design, collaborate, and give back to our community. This philosophy extends to our physical workspace as well. For example, our pit display frame is constructed using partially recycled materials, reflecting our commitment to reducing waste and promoting sustainable practices. By aligning our work with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, we strive to create a lasting positive impact that extends beyond the racetrack.
